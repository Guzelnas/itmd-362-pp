# Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens  

## The Problem  

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android/Google, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.  

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).
Focus on touch-related elements.  

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:  
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/  
* Android:  
  https://developer.android.com/design/index.html  
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:  
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design  

## Deliverables  

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:  

my.iit.edu from my phone (Pixel2):  
  ![alt text](https://github.com/Guzelnas/itmd-362-pp/blob/master/pp-04/_sketches/myIIT.png "Logo Title Text 1")  

* HCI Guidline One (URL):  
https://material.io/guidelines/usability/accessibility.html#accessibility-hierarchy-focus  

Important actions: Place important actions at the top or bottom of the screen (reachable with shortcuts)  
Related items: Place related items of a similar hierarchy next to each other  

* How you implemented it in your sketch:

Here I added login button at the top of the page because this is what my.iit.edu is for - to allow students to log in to their accounts. According to HCI guidelines for Android, the most important actions should be at the top of a webpage.     


* HCI Guidline Two (URL):
https://material.io/guidelines/usability/accessibility.html#accessibility-implementation   

* How you implemented it in your sketch:

There is too much going on on my.iit.edu; text appears very crowded. Also, it seems that text size is the same on the entire webpage. This is why I added a spacious layout and used scalable text. This also will help to accommodate users who may have large text or other assistive setting turned on.  

* HCI Guidline Three (URL):  
https://material.io/guidelines/components/bottom-navigation.html#bottom-navigation-usage  

* How you implemented it in your sketch:  
![alt text](https://github.com/Guzelnas/itmd-362-pp/blob/master/pp-04/_sketches/tree.jpg "Logo Title Text 1")  

The HCI guideline suggests using bottom navigation for 3-5 top-level destinations of similar importance. This is why I added "back to top" button, which will appear after users scroll down to the bottom of the webpage.
