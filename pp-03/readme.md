1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform  

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=10u0u0kxCCvtd9jlsmgQ2YEmKYy  
Your Rationale: http://paletton.com/#uid=10u0u0kxCCvtd9jlsmgQ2YEmKYy  

I choose red-orange because it creates a call to action - to buy something.
I like combination of black and orange because black makes orange to stand out even more. Also, black color looks kind of luxury.  

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens  

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=52F0z0kffD6ujlKiGiG6QYR01+Y    
Your Rationale: http://paletton.com/#uid=52F0z0kffD6ujlKiGiG6QYR01+Y  

I associate these colors with spring. I choose pastel, soft colors because nature is just awakening. I was thinking about adding more colors (such as pink or purple..), but changed my mind because images of flowers would stand out more with these colors in the background.  

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet  

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=32a0I0kv6stX2kIIQoUjWrQ7qq2  
Your Rationale: http://paletton.com/#uid=32a0I0kv6stX2kIIQoUjWrQ7qq2  

I choose red because it grabs attention, blue because it goes well with red and also creates a sense of well-being, and green because it calms down.  

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=b2i123x0k47nIork2aC5700+Q00X2    
Your Rationale:  

This is the hardest one. When I created this palette, I was thinking about what colors are associated with safety/protection; what colors makes me feel safe and protected. Also, I didn't want to make it look dull or depressive either.
