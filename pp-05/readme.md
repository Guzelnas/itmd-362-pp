# Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists each containing at least 25 items (use Google,
but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own,
condensed list of exactly ten items.

Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create
your own master usability checklist.

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

1. Do you have “white space?”: By placing too many elements too close together, you may overwhelm users. Spread things out a little.  

2. Have you offered contact information?: If your site doesn’t answer all of a visitor’s questions, they will probably want to speak to you about it. Allow them an easy way to contact you.  

3. Does your logo link home?: Users expect that your site’s main logo will always link to your homepage, so make sure you’ve done this.  

4. Have you used color properly?: Avoid placing light-colored text on a light-colored background, or it will be hard for visitors to read your content. The same goes for dark-on-dark.  

5. Is your site full of animation?: Cut down on unnecessary animations to avoid overwhelming the user.  

6. Have you tested alternative browsers?: Although the majority of the Internet is still on Internet Explorer, it’s vital that you make sure your page renders correctly in browsers like Firefox, Safari, Opera, and others.  

7. Links, buttons and checkboxes are easily clickable, for example a user can select a checkbox by clicking the text, not just the checkbox.  

8. Navigation is consistent on every page.  

9. Error messages are shown next to the input field, not just on top of the page.  

10. Site is responsive. Works with different screen sizes. There is no horizontal scrolling.
